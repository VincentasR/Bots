# Quick Chicken


one of the minigames of Moorhuhn Xtreme, where you have to shoot up as many chickens as you can. There are no time constraints, you have three lives (you loose one if you miss a chicken). This bot doesn't really do things perfectly **BUT** the point of my bots is to get a highscore (and this bot can go as high as infinity). It always looses one health, because the health bar covers a chicken that come out of the chimney.
